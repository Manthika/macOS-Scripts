# How to develop your own AirPod connect app

1. Open your spotlight search by pressing on command key and space bar then search for **Script Editor**.

2. Once you click on the **Script Editor** it will open a blank window as I have shown below.

3. Copy the script that I have provided in the [script.txt file](https://github.com/dilum1995/macOS-Scripts/blob/master/AirPods_connect_app/script.txt)

4. Change the **Dilumâ€™s AirPods** to your AirPod device name (you can take this from your bluetooth device list).

5. Save the script to your application folder as a macOS application.
